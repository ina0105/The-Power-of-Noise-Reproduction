### Common failure patterns in 1 doc

1. Partial name extraction
   - Example: "who is the yellow rose of texas named after"
   - 1 doc: `Emily Morgan` (partial)
   - 5/11 doc: `Emily D. West` (full name)

2. Wrong answer from same document
   - Example: "what is the name of latest version of android"
   - 1 doc: `Supported; See clarification Lollipop` (wrong version)
   - 5/11 doc: `Latest version of Android is Oreo` (correct)

3. Incomplete extraction (truncated)
   - Example: "when did budapest became the capital of hungary"
   - 1 doc: `BUDAPEST BECAME THE CAPITAL OF H` (truncated)
   - 5/11 doc: `1361` or `Budapest became the capital of Hungary in 1361.`

4. Wrong entity selection
   - Example: "who plays earl's dad in my name is earl"
   - 1 doc: `Carlton Hickey` (character name)
   - 5/11 doc: `Beau Bridges` or `Carlton Hickey (played by Beau Bridges)` (actor name)

5. Need for more context
   - Example: "who plays the doctor in sons of anarchy"
   - 1 doc: `Dr. Tara Knowles` (character)
   - 11 doc: `Maggie Siff` (actor — only 11 doc got this)

6. Comparison questions
   - Example: "who has more la liga titles real madrid or barcelona"
   - 1 doc: `BARCELONA` (wrong)
   - 5/11 doc: `REAL MADRID` (correct)

### Insights

1. More documents help with:
   - Full name extraction (first + last)
   - Disambiguation (character vs actor)
   - Comparison questions (requires multiple pieces of info)
   - Context-dependent answers

2. 11 doc advantages:
   - 409 cases where only 11 doc succeeds (5 doc also fails)
   - Better at finding answers that require more context
   - More robust to noise from distracting documents

3. All failures had the answer in the document, suggesting:
   - Extraction/formatting issues
   - Need for additional context to disambiguate
   - Difficulty identifying the correct answer when multiple candidates exist

These results suggest that more documents can improve accuracy, especially for questions requiring disambiguation, full names, or comparisons.
