The passage is about how the animal mind converts raw sense perceptions from the five specialized sense perceptions , into perceptions of real things moving and changing , which can be thought about . According to Aristotle 's understanding of perception , each of the five senses perceives one type of '' perceptible '' or '' sensible '' which is specific ( ἴδια , idia ) to it . For example , sight can see colour . But Aristotle was explaining how the animal mind , not just the human mind , links and categorizes different tastes , colours , feelings , smells and sounds in order to perceive real things in terms of the '' common sensibles '' ( or '' common perceptibles '' ) . In this discussion , '' common '' ( κοινή , koiné ) is a term opposed to specific or particular ( idia ) . The Greek for these common sensibles is tá koiná ( τά κοινᾰ́ , lit .
