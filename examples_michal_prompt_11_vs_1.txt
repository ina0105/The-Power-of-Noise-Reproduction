1. More documents help with:
   - Full name extraction (first + last)
   - Disambiguation (character vs actor, entity selection)
   - Comparison questions (requires multiple pieces of info)
   - Context-dependent answers
   - Better extraction from noisy/distracting contexts

2. 11 doc advantages:
   - 1154 cases where only 11 doc succeeds (1 doc fails)
   - Better at finding answers that require more context
   - More robust to noise from distracting documents
   - Improved accuracy: 0.4746 (11 doc) vs 0.4472 (1 doc)

3. All failures had the answer in the document, suggesting:
   - Extraction/formatting issues
   - Need for additional context to disambiguate
   - Difficulty identifying the correct answer when multiple candidates exist
   - Better prompt understanding with more context

These results suggest that more documents (11) can improve accuracy, especially for questions requiring disambiguation, full names, or comparisons.
